     <div className='main-line'></div>
     <p className="main-par">I am a young vibrant individual who spends my free time playing
Guitar and like to dabble in the arts of cooking from time to time.
I am very down to earth with a hint of energy for exploration
and curiosity. I would like to describe myself as 
in a sense where I can free my mind to my own creativity.
I stick to a set of rules when work needs to be done,
but I dont ground myself when I see an opportunity to take charge.
I strive for adventure in my path to success - inspired by the words
of my favourite philosopher:
</p><p className="main-par"><i>-”This is the real secret of life -
to be completely engaged with what you are doing
in the here and now.
And instead of calling it work, realize it as play.”</i></p>
